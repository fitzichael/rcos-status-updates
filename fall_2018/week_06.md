## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I started working on making the tree structure, but my partner broke
the front end, so I didn't get it working

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on fixing the tree structure, and also testing out postman
so that I don't have to depend on the front end

## Anything Blocking?



## Notes

I forgot to do this last week, so I'm doing it a week late
