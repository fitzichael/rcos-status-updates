## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I added the ability to edit parts of the database if the users edits 
their settings based off of the current settings

## This Week's Plan

This week I'll do more research into mongoDB, and try to find more ways to make the DB more efficient,
or just learn about different ways that I can use MongoDB

## Anything Blocking?
