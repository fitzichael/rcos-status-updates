## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I added more to the ability to edit. I've begun implementing a tree, such that each
edit traces back to an original pre edit piece object in the database, so that a tree of edits
can be followed


## This Week's Plan

This week I'm going to work more on the edit ability, and implement an undo button or something similar
to the website

## Anything Blocking?
