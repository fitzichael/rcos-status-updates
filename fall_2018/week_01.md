## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent this week learning how to use git and github, as well as familiarizing myself
with node, which is entirely new to me.

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to learn how to host the server on my laptop so that I can view progress made on it.
I'll also start working on the front end of the site, especially to familiarize myself with
CSS and HTML.

## Anything Blocking?
