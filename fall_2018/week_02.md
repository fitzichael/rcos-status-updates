## Last Week's Accomplishments

I familarized myself with mongoose, and how to connect and read/write data from the database. I also 
can now send data to the user when they request it from the url

## This Week's Plan

Figure out how to send a url that allows the user to see and edit their data once they follow it.

## Anything Blocking?
